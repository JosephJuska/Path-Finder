# Path-Finder
Path Finder which helps you find out if a path or file exists

DISCLAIMER: Created for testing purposes. Harmful uses are not advised, we do not carry any responsibilities and discourage such uses.

To use Path Finder, you need a text file filled with possible path or file names.

Inside should look like this:
-----------------------------
Name1
Name2
Name3
Name4
-----------------------------
...And so on.

Programme will search get the path of itself, break it into pieces.
Then the names inside the text file will be tested.
If file/path exists, it will say:
[path] EXISTS
Else:
[path] error
